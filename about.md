Hi, I’m Juan Pablo Prado.

I am a Software Engineer. A passionate Full Stack Web Developer. I live in Cancun, MX. I love writing code and lifting weights. Maybe one day I’ll write a proper bio. In the mean time you can check out my <a href="https://www.resumonk.com/juanpablo" target="_blank">resume</a>.
